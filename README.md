# Hi, I'm Gaurav Yadav 👋

💻 **Java Backend Developer | Spring Boot | System Design Learner**

I mainly work with **Java & Spring Boot** and enjoy designing APIs, optimizing performance, and solving real-world backend problems.  
I like understanding how systems work internally — not just writing code that runs, but code that scales.
